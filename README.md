Decided to make this because of a School Project.

PLEASE include 7z.exe in your build folder for this to work (Normally at: C:\Program Files\7-Zip)

If the app reports as 32-bit, it is. but the 7z.exe file i used for it, isn't.
you could replace it with a 32-bit version yourself.

Check the releases for a build.
